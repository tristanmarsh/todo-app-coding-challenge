# Todo List Web Application

[source](https://github.com/SleevesUpAU/coding-test-frontend/blob/master/PROBLEM.md)

## Context

In this project a Web application is built using Javascript, Html and css, which allows users to keep track of pending and completed tasks.

In the application, users can do the following:

- See the list of unfinished tasks
- See the list of completed tasks
- Create tasks
- Complete tasks
- Delete tasks

## Business Constraints

- Must not allow duplicated tasks
- Responsive design is good to have, but not mandatory
- Single Page Application is required

## Technical Constraints

- No backend components is required
- React is preferable
- Typescript is good to have, but not mandatory

## Project Submission

The whole project including the source code, tests and simple documentation about how to run the program

Perferably, send us a link to a public repository including the above

## Expectations

We're not just looking for any old solution that would solve the problem. We're looking for:

- production quality code
- good Object Oriented or functional practices
- a solid testing approach
- well thought out naming
- solid error handling
- extensibility/maintainability
- good design
- separation of concerns
- sensible breakdown of code into files/modules
- use of best practices when it comes to JS, CSS, testing etc.
- appropriate use of tools/frameworks
- etc

Basically treat the coding test as if it's part of a larger problem.

Thank you!
